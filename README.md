## Overview

This Python program demonstrates two methods for finding the maximum value in a list of integers. It showcases basic list manipulation techniques and the use of built-in functions in Python.

## Features

- Imports the `sqlite3` module (unused in this context).
- Initializes a list of integers.
- Finds the maximum value using:
  - A loop-based method.
  - The built-in `max()` function.
- Prints the maximum value from both methods.

## Usage

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. The maximum value from the predefined list will be printed using both methods.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
